        <h1>Supergirl</h2>
          <p>Kara Zor-El (Melissa Benoist) was sent to Earth from the doomed planet Krypton as a 13-year-old by her parents Zor-El (Robert Gant) and Alura (Laura Benanti). Alura gave her instructions to protect her infant cousin Kal-El, and informed her that she, like her cousin, would have extraordinary powers under Earth's yellow sun.</p>

          <p>Kara's spacecraft was knocked off course by a shock wave from Krypton's explosion and forced into the Phantom Zone, where it stayed for 24 years. During this period, time became suspended for Kara and when the spacecraft eventually escaped the Phantom Zone, she was still a 13-year-old girl. By the time the spacecraft crash landed on Earth, Kal-El had grown up and become Superman (Tyler Hoechlin). After helping her out of the craft, Superman took Kara to be adopted by his friends, the Danvers family. The series begins eleven years later when the now 24-year-old Kara is learning to embrace her powers after previously hiding them.
